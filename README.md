# MyAppV1

*/still in development*/

Just like having an own website, I made my own IOS app.
assets taken from google.


By making this app I learned how to use Lottie animations, create scroll parallax affects, use UIDocumentInteractionController, implement WebKit, swipe gestures, and 3D scroll Animations.
